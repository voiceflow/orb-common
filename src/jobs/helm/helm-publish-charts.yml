  # HACK: Re-push all of the new charts to the bucket.
  #       For some unknown reason the bucket breaks after we push new versions of
  #       the charts. This causes the helmrelease to take 14+ minutes to start.
  #       rather than 3s. This problem is fixed by force pushing the bucket again.
  #       Re-indexing the bucket does not work, but force-pushing does.
  #       I have no idea why this works, but it does. I have spent countless days
  #       trying to figure out why this happens, but I have not been able to.
  #       Based on investigations, the problem is in the S3 bucket, not in the
  #       cluster: https://www.notion.so/voiceflow/Dev-Env-Slow-Start-Bug-Investigation-0b6e08fa4e614a6098981557c4068b8e?pvs=4
